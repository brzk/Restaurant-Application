# Restaurant-Application

A C# application developed for fun and self-learning with emphasize on OOP and Design Patterns principles. The application manages dish orders in a restaurant. The main feature of the application is to sort the dishes before the waiter sends them to the kitchen, as some dishes must be prepared before the others. Hence, the waiter-kitchen relationship greatly improves. The project demonstrates usage of an SQL database and includes a testing infrastructure with different tests.
